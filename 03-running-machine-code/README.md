# Running Machine Code on Qemu and HiFive 1

Now we understand the boot process and how control passes to our programs, we need to get some code into the correct location to run it.

## Aims

- Be able to create machine-code files which can be run on Qemu or the HiFive1
- Run code on actual hardware and confirm the results

## File Formats for Qemu

TODO: Talk about ELF. Other kernel types?

## File Formats for HiFive1

TODO: Write about binary files and being able to upload to the correct place in flash.

## Running and Debugging Code

Now we're aware of the file formats needed to get runnable code on both platforms, let's actually run some code!

### Qemu

TODO: Run with gdb and inspect a register to check output

### HiFive1

TODO: Run with openocd/gdb and inspect a register to check output
