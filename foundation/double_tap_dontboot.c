// This is the 'bootloader' which ships on HiFive1 boards,
// at SPI Flash location 0x20000000.
// HiFive1 boards have code burned into their OTP which ends with
// a jump to 0x20000000. The Freedom E SDK and the Arduino IDE
// linker scripts cause user programs to be compiled and
// flashed at 0x20400000. Therefore, this code ultimately jumps
// to 0x20400000, while attempting to leave the machine state as close
// to its reset state as possible.
//
// When compiled in the freedom-e-sdk environment, this code will
// be compiled as a user program at 0x20400000, so will continuously jump to itself.
// It is provided in the freedom-e-sdk mostly for reference purposes, so
// users know what is running on their board. Replacing the bootloader
// at 0x20000000 is not currently supported by the SDK.
//
// These are the instructions for the user of this program, from the
// HiFive1 Getting Started Guide:
// 
// This program is designed to allow quick boot, but
// also a "safe" reboot option if a "bad" program
// is flashed into the HiFive1's SPI Flash. A "bad" program
// is one which makes it impossible for the programmer
// to communicate with the HiFive1. For example, a program which
// disables FE310's active clock, or which puts the FE310 to sleep
// with no way of waking it up. Bad programs can always be restarted using
// the RESET button, and using the "safe" bootloader can be halted
// before they perform any unsafe behavior.
//
// To activate "normal" boot mode, press the RESET button on
// the HiFive1. After approximately 1s, the green LED will flash
// for 1/2 second, then the user program will execute.
//
// To activate "safe" boot mode, press the RESET button. When
// the green LED flashes, immediately press the RESET button again.
// After 1 second, the red LED will blink. The user program will not
// execute, and the programmer can connect. To exit "safe" boot mode,
// press the RESET button a final time.
